UI ENHANCEMENT PROMPT:
I'm working on a large application that needs UI enhancement. The colors above (#0A3861 blue and #A8232F red) are my primary brand colors that must be used for the UI improvements.

Instructions for AI:
1. I will provide files one by one from my application.
2. For each file, ONLY enhance the visual appearance and UI elements using the two primary colors specified above.
3. Do NOT modify any functionality, logic, or backend operations of the application.
4. Do NOT create any new files - only implement changes in the existing files I provide.
5. Make sure your changes don't affect the application's performance or introduce any issues.
6. Focus on improving visual hierarchy, color contrast, accessibility, and overall aesthetic appeal.
7. If a file cannot be improved without affecting functionality, explain why and suggest minimal safe changes.

Detailed UI Enhancement Guidelines:
8. Create a cohesive design system using these colors: use #0A3861 (blue) for primary actions/headers and #A8232F (red) for accents/calls-to-action.
9. Apply appropriate color gradients, shadows, and highlights derived from these colors.
10. Enhance buttons, forms, cards, and navigation elements with these colors to create visual hierarchy.
11. Improve spacing, padding, and margins to create better visual balance.
12. Ensure sufficient contrast ratios between text and backgrounds for accessibility.
13. Implement hover/focus states using lighter/darker variations of these colors.
14. Use these colors for borders, dividers, and visual indicators to create a unified look.
15. Add subtle animations or transitions that incorporate these colors where appropriate.
16. Consider creating secondary/tertiary colors that complement these primary colors for backgrounds and less important elements.

The application is extensive, so strictly adhere to these guidelines when enhancing each file.
